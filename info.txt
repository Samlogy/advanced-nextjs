Error handling page:
    create a custom page --> ex: 404.tsx, 500.tsx, ...
    add custom error page --> _error.tsx 

Middleware: run the code before is the request completed using:
    conditionning statement:
    matcher: url, url list

Internationalized routing: switch language with router 
    ex: .../fr/blog --> .../en/blog

react 18 features: we can use all react 18 new features along side nextjs

build-in:
    link - 
    image - 
    router - 
    script (execute script --> internal / external)
    head --> add additional headers (seo purpose, ...)

Rendering (Nextjs):
    CSR: same as react --> useffect, ...
    SSR: data is loaded from the server
    SSG: page is generated on build time on server, immediately display to user
    ISR: same as SSG attempt to re-generate the page every "certain interval of time in seconds"


Environment variable: 
    .env.local --> call this way (process.env.VARIABLE_NAME)

Eslint: yarn lint --> linting code / verify linting warings & errors

Debouncing: used for optimizing the performance. 
            It is done by limiting the rate of execution of a particular function 
            (also known as rate limiting).
            ex: avoid rendenring every time we update a state

Throttling: is same as debounce --> limiting the rate of execution of function.
    ex: avoid multiple click on button that triggers the same function

NB: throttling & debouncing improve code optimization

Portals: The Portal's most common use cases are when the child components need to visually break out of the parent container
    ex: Modal - notification - toast - alerts - tooltips - loaders - ...

HOC: Higher Order Component --> a fct that calls another fct which can be used for create a cpt / condition rendering

ForwardRef: its a ref that is passed to child cpt from parent cpt the child cpt must wrapped
    ex: React.forwardRef(component)
